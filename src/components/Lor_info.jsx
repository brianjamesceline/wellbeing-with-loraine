            Sessions with my clients are based on trust, listening,
            understanding and offering a comfortable environment to encourage
            you to openly bring your thoughts, feelings and challenges into the
            session.

            I always wanted to be a Choreographer and loved Contemporary
            Dancing, Ballet and Tap. After attending numerous auditions, I began
            to realise the competition was fierce and knew that I'd really need
            to train hard and up my game, just to be successful in an audition.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            I decided to place my dancing on pause for a while and I secured a
            job within the Banking Industry. Over a 10 year career, my roles
            spanned from Customer Service Assistant, to Mortgage Advisor and
            completing my career as a Personal Financial Advisor.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            My hobby during this time was attending evening Aerobic classes at
            my local church hall. I became hooked and found my passion in health
            and fitness. I absolutely loved the idea of working out to
            choreographed dance moves with great music and the bonus was you'd
            get fit at the same time! Most of all it was fun and I always felt
            amazing afterwards with my energy levels through the roof.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            I thought to myself, I can do this and I just knew I'd be damn good
            at it, because I truly love music and I have the vision and
            creativity to plan and execute an excellent Aerobic class. I took a
            leap of faith, and enrolled on an Exercise and Health Studies one
            year evening course whilst working at the bank. I became a fully
            qualified Exercise To Music Instructor and gained my certificate in
            Exercise To Music from the Physical Education Association.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-5">
            I gave my notice at the bank and became a Freelance Group Exercise
            Instructor. Whilst this was a risk to go from a job that paid me a
            set wage every month to being self employed, I felt a sense of
            freedom and accomplishment. Twenty-nine years on and the passion and
            fire continues to burn bright and I still love helping clients get
            fit and healthy.

            After my Father's passing in 2015 and then my brother passed away
            unexpectedly in 2019. My brother was my best friend, my soulmate. He
            took care of me after our Father passed. We helped each other
            through the sadness and pain. We understood each other, we knew what
            the other was thinking and we were always, always laughing.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            I went through a dark period in my life after my bereavements and
            although I continued to exercise and train for myself, I took time
            out from teaching my clients. I struggled to find my purpose. I knew
            I wanted to be more than a Health and Fitness Instructor. I wanted
            to help people based on my life experiences and that being candour
            about my life would help and encourage people to live a happy,
            healthy, loving, successful and balanced life.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            Therefore becoming a Wellbeing Coach was the next step and
            essentially I had found my purpose. I somehow feel I was guided to
            this next chapter of my life and I am so excited about it.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            In my free time I love to listen to music. In fact I have music with
            me everywhere I go. Music takes me to another place and allows me to
            express who I truly am. There are so many incredible Artists out
            there.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            I love being in the company of like minded people, cooking, sharing
            good food, great conversation and a glass of Champagne. Life is for
            living! I'm grateful that I can laugh again.
